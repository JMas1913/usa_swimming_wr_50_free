## Overview
**The data for both the Men's 50 Free and Women's 50 Free was directly copied from the [USA Swimming website](https://www.usaswimming.org/times/data-hub/record-progressions) and pasted into Google Sheets and then downloaded as a .csv file.**

This quick analysis of the 50 Free LCM world record progression shows how the world record gets faster over time. 

* A simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed
* The data was cleaned up by removing duplicates and filling in the Null values where possible
* Counted the number of world records each country received for the event
* Counted the number of world records each athlete has achieved
* Created visualizations based on the information discovered
